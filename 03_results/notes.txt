1. three subs 253, 303, 955 replied that they had 16, 5, and 7 vax respectively
	obviously false, replaced with 1, 1, and 2 based on their replies to question about vax with specific vaccines
	prob bots anyway, but only three subjects so we keep them anyway
2. one sub claimed to have 17 yo, probably mistake, prolific requiers 18 >=, corrected to 18

3. based on sample characteristic:
	a. race recoded to white v. non-white
	b. covid_no to 0 and 1 >=
	c. get_covid to 0-1 & 2-3
	d. other sex randomly assigned to male or female
	e. covid_vax_no to 0 & 1-2 & 3-4

4. Minor issues with in-in events for subs 1098 1187 - corrected; only affected data of these two subs!!
